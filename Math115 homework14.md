### 15.2 

In how many different ways is it possible to answer the next chapter’s practice problems if:

- the first problem has four *true/false* questions,

    First problem: $2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16$ different ways to answer.

- the second problem requires choosing one of four alternatives, and

    Second problem: $4$ different ways to answer.

- the answer to the third problem is an $integer \ge 15$ and $\le 20$?

    Third problem: $15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20$ results in $6$ different ways to answer.

- This results in $16 * 4 * 6 = 384$ different ways to answer the next chapter’s practice problems.

### 15.12

Eight students—Anna, Brian, Caine,. . . —are to be seated around a circular table in a circular room. Two seatings are regarded as defining the same *arrangement* if each student has the same student on his or her right in both seatings: it does not matter which way they face. We’ll be interested in counting how many arrangements there are of these 8 students, given some restrictions.

- a) As a start, how many different arrangements of these 8 students around the table are there without any restrictions?
- b) How many arrangements of these 8 students are there with Anna sitting next to Brian?
- c) How many arrangements are there with if Brian sitting next to both Anna AND Caine?
- d) How many arrangements are there with Brian sitting next to Anna OR Caine?
