### 9.10
Indicate **true** or **false** for the following statements about the greatest common
divisor, and *provide counterexamples* for those that are **false**.

---
---
- a) If $gcd(a, b) \neq 1$ and $gcd(b, c) \neq 1$, then $gcd(a, c) \neq 1$.
    
    true. 

- b) If $a | bc$ and $gcd(a,b) = 1$, then $a|c$.
    
    true.

- c) $gcd(a^n, b^n) = (gcd(a, b))^n$

    true.  

- d) $gcd(ab, ac) = a * gcd(b, c)$
 
    true.

- e) $gcd(1 + a, 1 + b) = 1 + gcd(a,b)$

    false.

    counter example: $gcd(1 + 2, 1 + 1) = gcd(3, 2) = 1$ and $1 + gcd(2, 1) = 2$

- f) If an integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$ equals $1$, then so does some integer linear combination of $a$ and $b^2$. 

    true.

- g) If no integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$ equals $2$, then neither does any integer linear combination of $a^2$ and $b^2$.

    true.

### 9.12
Here is a game you can analyze with number theory and always beat me. We start with two distinct, positive integers written on a blackboard. Call them $a$ and $b$. Now we take turns. (Iâ€™ll let you decide who goes first.) On each turn, the player must write a new positive integer on the board that is the difference of two numbers that are already there. If a player cannot play, then they lose.

For example, suppose that $12$ and $15$ are on the board initially. Your first play
must be $3$, which is $15 - 12$. Then I might play $9$, which is $12 - 3$. Then you might play $6$, which is $15 - 9$. Then I can't play, so I lose.

- (a) Show that every number on the board at the end of the game is a multiple of $gcd(a, b)$.

    Treating this game as list data structure that starts with $a$ and $b$, $b \gt a$. The data structure populates itself with new elements by storing the difference $c$, $c = ListElement1 - ListElement2$ and all list elements are less than $max(a, b)$ and greater than zero. The list also doesn't accept duplicates. This is similar to a recursively defined set or a state machine.

    The recursive step or transition to add new integers for this game has the same characteristic or preserved invariant described by Euclid's algorithm:

    $gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, rem(a, b))$, $b \ne 0$

    So, every element appended to the list is a multiple of the pair $a, b$ and $gcd(a, b)$.

- (b) Show that every positive multiple of $gcd(a, b)$ up to $max(a, b)$ is on the board at the end of the game.
    
    The way this game is played, assuming $b \gt a$, $max(a, b) = b$ already exist at the start. $\checkmark$

    Every subsequent play has be a difference of two fo the current set of numbers on the board, and can't exist on the board and must be greater than zero. So, if $b \gt a$, then $c = b - a$ is the first move. Then $d_1 = b - c$ or $d_2 = a - c$ is the second move and so on. This branching results in all positive integers being added on the board having a formula:

     $OnBoard = b - q * gcd(a, b), q \in \Z^+$ and $OnBoard > 0$.

    This formula represents the set of all numbers on the board at the end of the game. $\checkmark$

- (c) Describe a strategy that lets you win this game every time.

    Assuming $b$ is greater than $a$, if $\frac{b}{gcd(a,b)}$ is odd then you should go first to win. If $\frac{b}{gcd(a,b)}$ is even then you should insist your opponent goes first so that you can win. This strategy works because we know every mulitple of the $gcd(a, b)$ less than $b$ and greater than zero will have to be played to complete a game.

### 3
For each of the following pairs of numbers, do the following:

i) Find $gcd(a, b)$

ii) Express the $gcd$ as a combination of $a$ and $b$.

---

- a) $(a, b) = (45, 36)$ 
    
    | $i$ | $q_i$ | $r_i$ | $s_i$ | $t_i$ |
    |-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|
    | -1  | -     | 45    | 1     | 0     |
    | 0   | -     | 36    | 0     | 1     |
    | 1   | 1     | 9     | 1     | -1    |
    | 2   | 4     | 0     | -4    | 5     |

    $gcd(45, 36) = 9 = 45(1) + 36(-1)$

- b) $(a, b) = (35, 22)$ 

    | $i$ | $q_i$ | $r_i$ | $s_i$ | $t_i$ |
    |-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|
    | -1  | -     | 35    | 1     | 0     |
    | 0   | -     | 22    | 0     | 1     |
    | 1   | 1     | 13    | 1     | -1    |
    | 2   | 1     | 9     | -1    | 2     |
    | 3   | 1     | 4     | 2     | -3    |
    | 4   | 2     | 1     | -5    | 8     |
    | 5   | 4     | 0     | 22    | -35   |

    $gcd(35, 22) = 1 = 35(-5) + 22(8)$

- c) $(a, b) = (331, 158)$ 

    | $i$ | $q_i$ | $r_i$ | $s_i$ | $t_i$ |
    |-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|
    | -1  | -     | 331   | 1     | 0     |
    | 0   | -     | 158   | 0     | 1     |
    | 1   | 2     | 15    | 1     | -2    |
    | 2   | 10    | 8     | -10   | 21    |
    | 3   | 1     | 7     | 11    | -23   |
    | 4   | 1     | 1     | -21   | 44    |
    | 5   | 1     | 0     | 32    | -67   |

    $gcd(331, 158) = 1 = 331(-21) + 158(44)$
