### 12.6

For each of the following pairs of simple graphs, either define an isomorphism between them, or prove that there is none. (We write $ab$ as shorthand for $(a â€” b)$.)

- (a)
    
    $G_1$ with $V_1 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}, E_1 = \{12, 23, 34, 14, 15, 35, 45\}$

    $G_2$ with $V_2 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}, E_2 = \{12, 23, 34, 45, 51, 24, 25\}$


```
G_1

6 degree is 0

Visual of graphs G_1 and G_2.
```

The pair of simples graphs above aren't isomorphic because they don't share equal number of vertices with the same degree. $\checkmark$

- (b)

    $G_3$ with $V_3 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}, E_3 = \{12, 23, 34, 14, 45, 56, 26\}$

    $G_4$ with $V_4 = \{a, b, c, d, e, f\}, E_4 = \{ab, bc, cd, de, ae, ef, cf\}$

```

Visual of graphs G_3 and G_4.
note: G_4 looks like a mirror image of G_3.

```

$f_3: V_{G_3} \rightarrow  V_{G_4}$ $f = {(1, f),(2, e),(3, d),(4, c),(5, b),(6, a)}$

Adjacencies matrix for $G_3$. note: "$G_3 = G_3$" is used to correct table alignment for a better visual.

| $G_3 = G_3$: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1      | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2      | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 3      | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 4      | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 5      | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 6      | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

Adjacencies matrix for $f_3(G3)$ (matches $G_3$)
| $f_3(G_3)$: | f | e | d | c | b | a |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| f          | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| e          | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| d          | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| c          | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| b          | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| a          | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

$f_3$ respects the number of vertices, edges, degree of vertex, adjacency, and cycles of a particular length, so it is an isomorphic pair of graphs. $\checkmark$

    ~~swapped $c \leftrightarrow d$:~~
    
    $f_7$: $f = {(1, a),(2, b),(3, d),(4, c),(5, e),(6, f)}$
    
    ~~swapped $e \leftrightarrow f$:~~
    
    $f_8$: $f = {(1, a),(2, b),(3, c),(4, d),(5, f),(6, e)}$

- conclusion:

    An observation about the two graphs is that they are clearly isomorphic. 
    
    The isomorphic mappings appear to be those that mirror one side to the other along an imaginary axis splitting $(1,2)$ or $(a, b)$. In other words, if a vertex on one side is mapped to the other side, all vertices from that same side have to also be mapped to its equivalent vertex on the other side. For example $f(3, 5) \rightarrow (c,e)$ or $f(3, 5) \rightarrow (d,f)$ and $f(4, 6) \rightarrow (d,f)$ or $f(4, 6) \rightarrow (c,e)$.
    Since $(a, b)$ exists on the "center line", so its isomorphic properties preserved regardless if they are swapped. $\checkmark$

### 12.8

Determine which among the four graphs pictured in Figure 12.24 are isomorphic.
For each pair of isomorphic graphs, describe an isomorphism between them. For
each pair of graphs that are not isomorphic, give a property that is preserved under
isomorphism such that one graph has the property, but the other does not. For
at least one of the properties you choose, *prove* that it is indeed preserved under
isomorphism (you only need prove one of them).

Table to account for vertices, edges, and degrees.

|       | vertex $\rightarrow$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | Edges |
|-------|----------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|-------|
| $G_1$ | degrees              | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3  | 15    |
| $G_2$ | degrees              | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3  | 15    |
| $G_3$ | degrees              | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4  | 16    |
| $G_4$ | degrees              | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3  | 15    |

- We eliminate $G_3$ because two of the vertices doesn't share the same degree compared to the other three graphs.

- Having ten vertices is a preserved property amongst $G_1, G_2, G_4$.

- Having vertices with a degree of three is a preserved property amongst $G_1, G_2, G_4$.

- Having fifteen edges is a preserved property amongst $G_1, G_2, G_4$.

- A Hamiltonian path is a preserved property amongst the $G_2$.

    $G_1{Hamiltonian Path} = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6, 10, 9$ (tried a few, going to say it doesn't exist for $G_1$)
    
    $G_2{Hamiltonian Path} = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 8, 7, 6, 1$ $\checkmark$
    
    $G_4{Hamiltonian Path} = 1, 2, 6, 5, 9, 8, 3, 4, 10, 7$ (tried a few, going to say it doesn't exist for $G_4$)

- Conclusion:
    - I believe $G_1$ and $G_4$ is an isomorphic pair, the work is shown below.  $\checkmark$ 
    
    - I feel like there should exist an isomorphism between $G_2$ with $G_1$ and $G_4$, but it is very tedious to find. So at this point I'd have to say $G_2$ can't form an isomorphic pair with $G_1$ and $G_4$. The reason might be the same reason we couldn't connect the utilities in the house in the lectures notes. It has something to do with crossing edges.

    - The work: The $G_1$ and $G_4$ pair was found by untying $G_1$ into $G_4$.

- a) 

```

|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
2---------2         1

A graph with 6 vertices. The numbers represent the degree for each vertex.

```

- b) The incorrect proof comes in during the base case when "**Base case** $(n = 1)$: The only two-ended graph with a single edge consists of two vertices joined by an edge:"

    - a counter example would be:

```
1
|            3
|              
|   
2

A two-ended graph with vertices 1, 2, and 3. An edge joins vertices 1 and 2.
```
Vertices 1, 2 form a two-ended graph with a single edge, but there are 3 points. $\checkmark$

### RSA encryption problem
You have intercepted some messages sent on a popular dating site.  The person sending these messages has the address $(n_1, e_1) = (96403, 31)$.  The person receiving these messages has the address $(n_2, e_2) = (405319, 29)$.

Message1:

[227631, 175041, 262106, 49893, 67508, 265405, 112056, 15517, 346109, 269901, 363337, 112056, 80936, 175102, 266472]

You've discovered that the modulus in the receiver's public key, $n=405319$, is the product of the primes $409$ and $991$.  Use this information to break the RSA encryption.  Pick one of the above questions (or more if you want), decrypt it, and send a reply to the sender.  

- Going to decrypt message 3:

    Modulus recievers public key, $n = 405319$.

    Product of primes $409$ and $991$.

    $(n, e) = (409, 991)

    To decrypt this, we need to computer the inverse of "$e^{-1}$  $mod (p - 1)(q - 1)$"

    $(p - 1)(q - 1) = 408 * 990 = 403920$
    
- extended Euclidean algorithm:

    $a = r_{-1}, b = r_0$
    
    $a * s_i + b * t_i = r_i$, then iterate until $r_i$ equals to zero.
    
    $i$ is the index
    
    $q_i$ is the quotient
    
    $r_i$ is the remainder
    
    $s_i, t_i$ are the Bezout coefficients

| $i$ | $q_i$                | $r_i$      | $s_i$              | $t_i$                         |

| 6   | 2 // 1 = 2           | 0          | -                  | -                             |

$gcd = (11)403920 + (-153211)29$

An inverse of $29$ $mod 403920$ is $-153211$, which is congruent to $250709$ $mod 403920$

So the description exponent, $e^{-1} = 250709$

Then take the $MessageElement^{e^{-1}}$ $mod$ $n$ for each element in the message.
